A sub-Saharan Tanzanian boy is drinking coke.
Bloated belly, empty eyes and matchstick arms and legs to match.
Coca Cola, Pepsi, Dr. Pepper. Flies.
Boy drinks, then smiles faintly: "Life begins here."
At last, the flies and self digestion finally overcome and he plunges
into oblivion while thinking of that distant American dream.
