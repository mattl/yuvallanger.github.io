================

* Speech recognition sucks.
* Speech recognition sucks.
* You can't make a transcript of the hangout cheaply.
* You can't search the transcript (IRC is `grep`-able)
* IRC has the backlog presented to you at any time of the conversation. You can never miss anything said, unless you go offline.
* Hangouts are unscripted and filled with [speech disfluency] and although IRC is too unscripted, there is plenty of time to express yourself more eloquently.
    * Some people are [misophonic] and have low tolerance to:
        * Coughing
        * Sneezing
        * Gulping
        * Breathing
        * Rustling of clothes

Replace IRC with any other text based discussion system.
